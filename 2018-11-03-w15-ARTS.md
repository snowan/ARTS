/**
 * 817. LinkedList Components
 *
 * We are given head, the head node of a linked list containing unique integer values.
 *
 * We are also given the list G, a subset of the values in the linked list.
 *
 * Return the number of connected components in G, where two values are connected if
 * they appear consecutively in the linked list.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input:
 * head: 0->1->2->3
 * G = [0, 1, 3]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation:
 * 0 and 1 are connected, so [0, 1] and [3] are the two connected components.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input:
 * head: 0->1->2->3->4
 * G = [0, 3, 1, 4]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation:
 * 0 and 1 are connected, 3 and 4 are connected, so [0, 1] and [3, 4] are the two
 * connected components.
 * Note:
 *
 * If N is the length of the linked list given by head, 1 <= N <= 10000.
 * The value of each node in the linked list will be in the range [0, N - 1].
 * 1 <= G.length <= 10000.
 * G is a subset of all values in the linked list.

### [R] - [Zookeeper](https://data-flair.training/blogs/zookeeper-tutorial/) 
--
1. What is Zookeeper?
   >ZooKeeper is a distributed, open-source coordination service for distributed applications. It exposes a simple set of primitives that distributed applications can build upon to implement higher level services for synchronization, configuration maintenance, and groups and naming.

2. [Zookeeper Features](https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.4.13/zookeeperOver.html#guarantees)
  - Sequential Consistency - Updates from a client will be applied in the order that they were sent.

  - Atomicity - Updates either succeed or fail. No partial results.

  - Single System Image - A client will see the same view of the service regardless of the server that it connects to.

  - Reliability - Once an update has been applied, it will persist from that time forward until a client overwrites the update.

  - Timeliness - The clients view of the system is guaranteed to be up-to-date within a certain time bound.

**Zookeeper Architecture:**

The following figure shows the relationship between servers and clients.
![alt text](./images/zk_arch.png)

1. Zookeeper mode
   - Standalone - meaning zookeeper has a single server
   - quorum - meaning it has a gourp of Zookeeper servers

2. ZooKeeper Atomic Broadcast(ZAB) protocal VS Paxos 
   - **Leader** - 
        - Leader will handle all transaction requests (global unique ID (ZXID)).
        - Leader is responsible for transfering a client request to Proposal, and sent the proposal to all followers
        - Leader wait for followers response, it requires more than half responses from followers
        - Leader gets more than half ACK, will sent commit request to all followers
   - **Follower** - response to leader, and keep connection with leader

#### ZAB models
- Broadcast
    - use atomic broadcast protocal, similar to 2PC protocal (below figure is from [1])

    ![alt text](./images/zab_broadcast.png)

    - Based on FIFO queue to build a **TCP** connection, it guarantees sequential order
    - Leader creates global unique Id for each Proposal called **ZXID**
    - Leader allocates a Queue for each Follower
    - Follower receives Proposal, will write into local disk, response (ACK) to Leader once successfully written
    - Leader receives more than half ACK, broadcast a commit (Proposal commit msg) to all Followers, complete commit
  
- Failover and recover
  - It will re-elect new leader when old leader, notify all follows
  - It guarantees all committed transaction will commited by all servers.

ZAB 3 phases:
1. Discover
2. Synchronization
3. Broadcast
   
below figure is coming from [1].

![alt text](./images/zab_phase.png)

Zookeeper Components (below figure is from [3])

![alt text](./images/zk_comp.png)
>The replicated database is an in-memory database containing the entire data tree. Updates are logged to disk for recoverability, and writes are serialized to disk before they are applied to the in-memory database.
>
>Every ZooKeeper server services clients. Clients connect to exactly one server to submit irequests. Read requests are serviced from the local replica of each server database. Requests that change the state of the service, write requests, are processed by an agreement protocol.
>
>As part of the agreement protocol all write requests from clients are forwarded to a single server, called the leader. The rest of the ZooKeeper servers, called followers, receive message proposals from the leader and agree upon message delivery. The messaging layer takes care of replacing leaders on failures and syncing followers with leaders.
>
>ooKeeper uses a custom atomic messaging protocol. Since the messaging layer is atomic, ZooKeeper can guarantee that the local replicas never diverge. When the leader receives a write request, it calculates what the state of the system is when the write is to be applied and transforms this into a transaction that captures this new state.

### [S] - [Apple News’s Radical Approach: Humans Over Machines](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/apple-news-humans-algorithms.html)
---
This article talked about Apple News use human resource like Ms. Kern to select head news rather than Machine (algorithms).
>The former journalist has quietly become one of the most powerful figures in English-language media. The stories she and her deputies select for Apple News regularly receive more than a million visits each.

Even with companis like Apple, using human resources to select head news, then what about others? so it raised some doubts / questions to think about? 

1. Why Apple cannot select head news by Algorithms?
2. How far (difference) between AI and human? 
3. Machine Learning isn't good enough to do recommendation jobs?
4. What about all the news / articles about machine (AI) will replace human labor?
5. All lie? if not, how far it already reached?
