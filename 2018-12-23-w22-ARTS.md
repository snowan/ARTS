```java
package leetcode;

/**
 * 673. Number of Longest Increasing Subsequence
 * <p>
 * Given an unsorted array of integers, find the number of longest increasing subsequence.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * Input: [1,3,5,4,7]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The two longest increasing subsequence are [1, 3, 4, 7] and [1, 3, 5, 7].
 * Example 2:
 * Input: [2,2,2,2,2]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: The length of longest continuous increasing subsequence is 1, and there are 5 subsequences' length is 1, so output 5.
 * Note: Length of the given array will be not exceed 2000 and the answer is guaranteed to be fit in 32-bit signed int.

public class NumberOfLIS673 {
  // solution: dynamic programming(DP), at nums[i], we can get longest length[i], and counts[i],
  // for each i < j, with nums[i] < nums[j], we compare the longest length length[i] and length[j],
  // if longest length[j] + 1 == length[i] -> append nums[j] into longest length[i] -> length[i] + 1.
  // thus the total count will be count[i] + count[j]
  // if longest length[j] + 1 > length[i] -> we need to update longest length[i] = length[j] + 1, 
  // and update count -> count[i] = count[j].

### [R] - [Why Python is slow](https://hackernoon.com/why-is-python-so-slow-e5074b6fe55b)

Was discussing this topic with a friend who uses Python for development. And found some good resources online. 

This article explains why Python is slow from 3 different views:
>- It is GIL(Global Interpreter Lock)
>- Python is interpreted not compiled language
>- Python is Dynamically typed language

About why Python is slow, there are some answers on [Quora - why is Python slower than other languages](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Python-slower-than-other-languages)

And Article and discussion on [HackNews - why Python is slow?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12025309)

Mac OS has its own powerful trackpads, forth touch, e.g. you can drag a window to the side of the screen to rearrange the window to split into left/right half, or full screen etc.

With BetterTouchTool, you can do more, check it out and play with it.  

### [S] - [Why Kubernetes is Awesome - A beginner's guid](https://medium.com/@jandavid.staerk/why-kubernetes-is-awesome-9f7ff0186996)

A beginner friend guid for starting to play around with Kubernetes. 

It includes a brief introduction of what is k8s, basic concepts of nodes, pods, cluster.

Steps on how to deploy an application to k8s cluster.
