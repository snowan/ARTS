/**
 * 297. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree
 *
 * Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that
 * it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be
 * reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.
 *
 * Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your
 * serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can
 * be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * You may serialize the following tree:
 *
 *     1
 *    / \
 *   2   3
 *      / \
 *     4   5
 *
 * as "[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]"
 * Clarification: The above format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree. You do not
 * necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.
 *
 * Note: Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and deserialize
 * algorithms should be stateless.

 * '*' could be treated as a single right parenthesis ')' or a single left parenthesis '(' or an empty string.
 * An empty string is also valid.

### [R] -  [Raft](https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf)
---
## What is Raft? What problem is raft trying to solve?

raft is a consensus algorithm which solves the same consensus problem Paxos trying to solve but with a much simpler understandbility

## How Raft solved this consensus problem?

Raft decomposes the consensus problem into three relatively independent subproblems

- **Leader election:** a new leader must be chosen when an existing leader fails
- **Log replication:** the leader must accept log entries from clients and replicate them across the cluster, forcing the other logs to agree with its own
- **Safety**: if any server has applied a particular log entry to its state machine, then no other server may apply a different command for the same log index.

    Safety Property:

    - **Election Safety**: at most one leader can be elected in a given term.
    - **Leader Append-Only**: a leader never overwrites or deletes entries in its log; it only appends new entries.
    - **Log Matching**: if two logs contain an entry with the same index and term, then the logs are identical in all entries up through the given index.
    - **Leader Completeness:** if a log entry is committed in a given term, then that entry will be present in the logs of the leaders for all higher-numbered terms.
    - **State Machine Safety**: if a server has applied a log entry at a given index to its state machine, no other server will ever apply a different log entry for the same index.

## Details of Raft algorithm:

### Basics:

At any given time each server is in one of three states: *leader*, *follower*, or *candidate*

![alt text](images/raft_server_state.png)

### Leader election:

- Raft uses a heartbeat mechanism to trigger leader election.
    1. Leaders send periodic heartbeats to all followers in order to maintain their authority. If a follower receives no communication over a period of time called the election timeout, then it assumes there is no viable leader and begins an election to choose a new leader.
    2. To begin an election, a follower increments its current term and transitions to candidate state. It then votes for itself and issues RequestVote RPCs in parallel to each of the other servers in the cluster until one of below three happens.

        (a) It wins the election. Raft used simple first-come-first-served election mechanism

        (b) Another server establishes itself as leader. If Term(leader) ≥ Term(candidate), accept; else, reject.

        (c) Timeout without winner. If many followers become candidates at the same time, votes could be split so that no candidate obtains a majority. To prevent split votes in the first place, election timeouts are chosen randomly from a fixed interval (e.g., 150–300ms).

### **Log Replication:**

**Once leader elected, leader will take over all requests from client and send replicated log to followers. If follower crashed, leader will retry indefinitely.**

![alt text](images/raft_logs.png)

Logs are organized as the picture above. Each log entry stores a state machine command along with the term number when the entry was received by the leader. The term numbers in log entries are used to detect inconsistencies between logs and to ensure some of the properties in ***Safety Property*** Each log entry also has an integer index identifying its position in the log.

A log entry is `committed` once the leader that created the entry has replicated it on a majority of the servers (e.g., entry 7 in Figure 6).

Raft maintains the following properties, which together constitute the **Log Matching Property**:

- If two entries in different logs have the same index and term, then they store the same command.

    *This property follows from the fact that a leader creates at most one entry with a given log index in a given term, and log entries never change their position in the log.*

- If two entries in different logs have the same index and term, then the logs are identical in all preceding entries.

    *This property is guaranteed by a simple consistency check performed by AppendEntries.*

Example of followers’ logs may differ from that of a new leader. A follower may be missing entries that are present on the leader, it may have extra entries that are not present on the leader, or both. Missing and extraneous entries in a log may span multiple terms.

![alt text](images/raft_example.png)

- In Raft, the leader handles inconsistencies by forcing the followers’ logs to duplicate its own. This means that conﬂicting entries in follower logs will be overwritten with entries from the leader’s log.
- To bring a follower’s log into consistency with its own, the leader must ﬁnd the latest log entry where the two logs agree, delete any entries in the follower’s log after that point, and send the follower all of the leader’s entries after that point.
- When a leader ﬁrst comes to power, it initializes all nextIndex values to the index just after the last one in its log (11 in Figure 7). If follower's log is inconsistent with leader's, leader will keep send decremented nextIndex until find a match and doing consistence sync with above action.

### Safety

**Election restriction:**

- Raft guarantees that all the committed entries from previous terms are present on each new leader from the moment of its election, without the need to transfer those entries to the leader. This means that log entries only ﬂow in one direction, from leaders to followers, and leaders never overwrite existing entries in their logs.
- Raft uses the voting process to prevent a candidate from winning an election unless its log contains all committed entries. The RequestVote RPC implements this restriction: the RPC includes information about the candidate’s log, and the voter denies its vote if its own log is more up-to-date than that of the candidate.
- Raft determines which of two logs is more up-to-date by comparing the index and term of the last entries in the logs. If the logs have last entries with different terms, then the log with the later term is more up-to-date. If the logs end with the same term, then whichever log is longer is more up-to-date.

**Committing entries from previous terms:**

Figure 8 illustrates a situation where an old log entry is stored on a majority of servers, yet can still be overwritten by a future leader.

![alt text](images/raft_leader.png)

Committing entries from previous terms:

- To eliminate problems like the one in Figure 8, Raft never commits log entries from previous terms by counting replicas.
- Only log entries from the leader’s current term are committed by counting replicas; once an entry from the current term has been committed in this way, then all prior entries are committed indirectly because of the Log Matching Property.

## Cluster membership changes

It isn’t possible to atomically switch all of the servers at once, so the cluster can potentially split into two independent majorities during the transition.
![alt text](images/raft_cluster.png)

In Raft the cluster ﬁrst switches to a transitional conﬁguration we call *joint consensus*; once the joint consensus has been committed, the system then transitions to the new conﬁguration. The joint consensus combines both the old and new conﬁgurations:

- Log entries are replicated to all servers in both conﬁgurations.
- Any server from either conﬁguration may serve as leader.
- Agreement (for elections and entry commitment) requires separate majorities from both the old and new conﬁgurations.

The joint consensus allows individual servers to transition between conﬁgurations at different times without compromising safety. Furthermore, joint consensus allows the cluster to continue servicing client requests throughout the conﬁguration change.

- When the leader receives a request to change the conﬁguration from C old to C new , it stores the conﬁguration for joint consensus (C old,new in the ﬁgure) as a log entry and replicates that entry using the mechanisms described previously.
- Once a given server adds the new conﬁguration entry to its log, it uses that conﬁguration for all future decisions (a server always uses the latest conﬁguration in its log, regardless of whether the entry is committed).
- This means that the leader will use the rules of C old,new to determine when the log entry for C old,new is committed. If the leader crashes, a new leader may be chosen under either C old or C old,new , depending on whether the winning candidate has received C old,new . In any case, C new cannot make unilateral decisions during this period.
- Once C old,new has been committed, neitherC old norC new can make decisions without approval of the other, and the Leader Completeness Property ensures that only servers with the C old,new log entry can be elected as leader.
- It is now safe for the leader to create a log entry describing C new and replicate it to the cluster.
- When the new conﬁguration has been committed under the rules of C new , the old conﬁguration is irrelevant and servers not in the new conﬁguration can be shut down.

![alt text](images/raft_timeline.png)

Three more issues need to address:

1. Raft will let new servers join the cluster as non-voting members to make sure new members have enough time to catch up
2. Old leader may not included in new configuration. So there will be a period of time (while it is committing C new ) when the leader is managing a cluster that does not include itself; it replicates log entries but does not count itself in majorities until all C new goes in effect.
3. Removed servers may keep sending request votes with new term numbers. To prevent this problem, servers disregard RequestVote RPCs when they believe a current leader exists.

### [S] - [Migrating Messenger storage to optimize performance](https://code.fb.com/core-data/migrating-messenger-storage-to-optimize-performance/)
---
To improve Facebook Messager to be faster, more efficient, more reliable, and easier to upgrage with new features, major changes include:
1. redisign and simplify data schema, created a new source-of-truth index from existing data, and made consistent invariants to ensure that all data is formatted correctly.
2. We moved from HBase, an open source distributed key-value store based on HDFS, to [MyRocks](https://code.fb.com/core-data/myrocks-a-space-and-write-optimized-mysql-database/)
3. We moved from storing the database on spinning disks to flash on our new [Lightning Server SKU](https://code.fb.com/data-center-engineering/introducing-lightning-a-flexible-nvme-jbof/).

To make sure migrate with zero downtime, migrate workflow:

### Normal Migration flow

### Buffer Migration flow
![alt text](/images/fb_massenger_buffer_migrate_flow.png)


### Benefits
Compared with HBase, MyRocks at Facebook has more mature and more automated features to handle disaster recovery. In cases where we need to completely switch to another data center, we no longer need to involve human supervisors and perform manual operations. Automation makes switching data centers orders of magnitude faster than with the old system.

MyRocks is optimized in both reading and writing, and by leveraging Lightning with flash storage, we realized latency wins, in part because we are no longer bound on I/O in HBase. Read latency is now 50 times lower than in the previous system. People using Messenger can see that it is now much faster to scroll back though old messages. MyRocks is also more resilient.
