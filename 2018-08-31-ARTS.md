/**
 * 290. Word Pattern
 *
 * Given a pattern and a string str, find if str follows the same pattern.
 *
 * Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in str.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat dog"
 * Output: true
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input:pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat fish"
 * Output: false
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: pattern = "aaaa", str = "dog cat cat dog"
 * Output: false
 * Example 4:
 *
 * Input: pattern = "abba", str = "dog dog dog dog"
 * Output: false
 * Notes:
 * You may assume pattern contains only lowercase letters, and str contains lowercase letters separated by a single space.

 * 291. Word Pattern II
 *
 * Given a pattern and a string str, find if str follows the same pattern.
 * Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty substring in str.
 *
 * Examples:
 * pattern = "abab", str = "redblueredblue" should return true.
 * pattern = "aaaa", str = "asdasdasdasd" should return true.
 * pattern = "aabb", str = "xyzabcxzyabc" should return false.

 * Notes:
 * You may assume both pattern and str contains only lowercase letters.

  /**
   * This is much harder than word pattern which gave you a space separated strings.
   * Now you will need to self define string.
   * In this case, we will need to split string one by one to match the character in pattern.
   * Using one map character to string, and a set to store the defined string,
   * Backtracking string to match all characters
   *
   * E.g: pattern: "abab", string: "redblueredblue"
   * 'a' -> "r", 'b' -> "e", 'a' -> "d" (not match, first one match "r"), now backtrack
   * let 'b' -> ed", 'a' -> "b" (still not match), backtracking~
   * continue~~ until the whole string not match.
   *
   * now let 'a' -> "re", 'b' -> "d" ~ continue the process, not matching, then backtracking
   * ...
   * ...
   * let 'a' -> "red", 'b' -> "blue", all match, then return true.
   *
   * Keep backtracking the character and string matching, not then backtracking, found then return true.
   * Using recursive backtracking solution.
   *
   * let pattern be n, string be m, here
   * big O: O(m ^ n)

### [R] - How to Design a Scalable Rate Limiter
------
Rate Limiting protects your APIs from overuse by limiting how often each user can call the API. This limiting is to control the large requests coming from one user to prevent usage of insufficient resources and system instability. Using Rate Limiting, the requests per second (QPS) can be limited to a fixed number, to prevent starve other consumers, and prevent the "spike" requests per user. 

How we design a Rate Limiter, here we will focus on some algorithms to implement Rate Limiter:
1. Maintain a Queue to record the time for every request. check previous requesting time when new request comes, if it is less than Rate, then reject. 
as below image, here we assume, we maintain a 1s queue, if the requests come within 1s, then we added into queue, otherwise, we reject. 

![alt text](https://github.com/snowan/ARTS/blob/w6-arts/images/rate_limiter_queue.png)

2.[Leaky Token](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Leaky_bucket) 
Leaky token is an algorithm based on an analogy of how a bucket with a leak will overflow if either the average rate at which water is poured in exceeds the rate at which the bucket leaks or if more water than the capacity of the bucket is poured in all at once, and how the water leaks from the bucket at an (almost) constant rate.

You can think of a queue (FIFO) as a bucket holding the requests. If the queue is full, then additional requests will be discarded.
![alt text](https://github.com/snowan/ARTS/blob/w6-arts/images/leaky_token.png)

Here has two variables:
- one the bucket size, how much water can burst into bucket. 
- constant rate of dropping the water from bottom of the bucket. 

Pros:
- Easy to implement
- It smooths out bursts of requests 
- Process requests at constant rate

Cons: 
- A burst of traffic can fill up the queue with old requests
- Once filled with old requests, it will starve more recent requests from being processed.
- No guarantee that requests get processed in a fixed amount of time
- Need policy to coordinate and enforce the limit between load balance servers for fault tolerance or increased throughput.

3. [Token Bucket](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Token_bucket)

Token Bucket is an algorithm (similar to Leaky token), but in opposite way. 
- A token (water) is added to the bucket every 1/QPS seconds. 
- The bucket can hold the most b tokens (capacity), the token is discarded if the bucket is full. 
- New request comes and get one token, if there is no token left in bucket, then the request will be blocked or rejected service.

[ **Google Guava Rate Limiter** ](https://github.com/google/guava/blob/master/guava/src/com/google/common/util/concurrent/RateLimiter.java) has implemented Rate Limiter with Token Bucket algorithm.

### [T] - Interview Tips 
------
I have been interviewer for a while now, most of time I interview a coding session or peer presentation session, when coding session, I usually ask a candidate a midium level algorithm questions, will have follow ups if the candidate finishs the question very quick.

For coding session, don't jump right into the solution, try to clearify problem with interviewer, and ask some questions (maybe some candidate have already seen the questions before, so you don't need to be hurry on it, ask some corner case questions, like whether the array is fixed array, or is it a stream data? or whether the array contains duplicate elements etc). When you stuck, don't stuck there, interviewer is willing to help, and assume that interviewer may not know the solution either, so you both will discuss the solutions, and improve the solution together (interviwer also want to know whether he/she is happy to work with you together as a potential co-worker within an hour).

- **Ask questions, Ask questions, Ask questions** 

For system design session, usually the question will be vague, you must **ask questions**, and list data (if you are not sure, ask). 

- Understand / be clear about the requirements.
- Do Analysis (list the functions/objects you will need for the question)
- Using Data to support your architecture, the more detailed, the more convinced.
- QPS (query per second), Peak data.

E.g Designing a Scalable Uber system

- What business values we need to deliver?
  list the obejcts, Uber, has Rider (request a ride), Driver(receive a request), Payment(pay and go)
- What is the maximum distance between a driver and a rider for a driver to be visible to a user?
- Are we supporting pool?
- What is the criterion to show a shared driver to a user?
- How to divid the shared pool?
- How many requests(QPS) should the system handle?
- What happens when multiple users request the same driver?
- Does this system require high consistency/high availability/persistency?
...

Play a role that you are working with the interviewers. Be nervous is normal, ask questions when you are not sure.
