/**
 * 904. Fruit Into Baskets
 *
 * In a row of trees, the i-th tree produces fruit with type tree[i].
 *
 * You start at any tree of your choice, then repeatedly perform the following steps:
 *
 * Add one piece of fruit from this tree to your baskets.  If you cannot, stop.
 * Move to the next tree to the right of the current tree.  If there is no tree to the right, stop.
 * Note that you do not have any choice after the initial choice of starting tree: you must perform step 1,
 * then step 2, then back to step 1, then step 2, and so on until you stop.
 *
 * You have two baskets, and each basket can carry any quantity of fruit, but you want each basket to only carry one
 * type of fruit each.
 *
 * What is the total amount of fruit you can collect with this procedure?
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: [1,2,1]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: We can collect [1,2,1].
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: [0,1,2,2]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: We can collect [1,2,2].
 * If we started at the first tree, we would only collect [0, 1].
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: [1,2,3,2,2]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: We can collect [2,3,2,2].
 * If we started at the first tree, we would only collect [1, 2].
 * Example 4:
 *
 * Input: [3,3,3,1,2,1,1,2,3,3,4]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: We can collect [1,2,1,1,2].
 * If we started at the first tree or the eighth tree, we would only collect 4 fruits.
 *
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * 1 <= tree.length <= 40000
 * 0 <= tree[i] < tree.length

/**
 * 929. Unique Email Addresses
 *
 * Every email consists of a local name and a domain name, separated by the @ sign.
 *
 * For example, in alice@leetcode.com, alice is the local name, and leetcode.com is the domain name.
 *
 * Besides lowercase letters, these emails may contain '.'s or '+'s.
 *
 * If you add periods ('.') between some characters in the local name part of an email address,
 * mail sent there will be forwarded to the same address without dots in the local name.
 * For example, "alice.z@leetcode.com" and "alicez@leetcode.com" forward to the same email address.
 * (Note that this rule does not apply for domain names.)
 *
 * If you add a plus ('+') in the local name, everything after the first plus sign will be ignored.
 * This allows certain emails to be filtered, for example m.y+name@email.com will be forwarded to my@email.com.
 * (Again, this rule does not apply for domain names.)
 *
 * It is possible to use both of these rules at the same time.
 *
 * Given a list of emails, we send one email to each address in the list.
 * How many different addresses actually receive mails?
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: ["test.email+alex@leetcode.com","test.e.mail+bob.cathy@leetcode.com","testemail+david@lee.tcode.com"]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: "testemail@leetcode.com" and "testemail@lee.tcode.com" actually receive mails
 *
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * 1 <= emails[i].length <= 100
 * 1 <= emails.length <= 100
 * Each emails[i] contains exactly one '@' character.

/**
 * 482. License Key Formatting
 *
 * You are given a license key represented as a string S which consists only alphanumeric character and dashes.
 * The string is separated into N+1 groups by N dashes.
 *
 * Given a number K, we would want to reformat the strings such that each group contains exactly K characters,
 * except for the first group which could be shorter than K, but still must contain at least one character.
 * Furthermore, there must be a dash inserted between two groups and all lowercase letters should be converted to uppercase.
 *

 *
 * Input: S = "5F3Z-2e-9-w", K = 4
 *
 * Output: "5F3Z-2E9W"
 *
 * Explanation: The string S has been split into two parts, each part has 4 characters.
 * Note that the two extra dashes are not needed and can be removed.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: S = "2-5g-3-J", K = 2
 *
 * Output: "2-5G-3J"
 *
 * Explanation: The string S has been split into three parts, each part has 2 characters
 * except the first part as it could be shorter as mentioned above.
 * Note:
 *
 * The length of string S will not exceed 12,000, and K is a positive integer.

**High Level Architecture**

![text alt](/images/borg_arch.png)

## Architecture

### Borgmaster

two main processes: main Borgmaster process and scheduler

- Borgmaster: The Borgmaster is logically a single process but is actually replicated ﬁve times. It mainly does following works:
    1. handle client RPCs, including mutate state or provide read-only access
    2. manage state machines for all of the objects in the system
    3. communicates with the Borglets
- Scheduler: When a job is submitted, the Borgmaster records it persistently in the Paxos store and adds the job’s tasks to the pending queue. This is scanned asynchronously by the scheduler, which assigns tasks to machines if there are sufﬁcient available resources that meet the job’s constraints.
    1. feasibility checking: ﬁnd machines on which the task could run:

        *In feasibility checking, the scheduler ﬁnds a set of machines that meet the task’s constraints and also have enough “available” resources – which includes resources assigned to lower-priority tasks that can be evicted*

    2. scoring: picks one of the feasible machines:

        *In scoring, the scheduler determines the “goodness” of each feasible machine. The score takes into account user-speciﬁed preferences, but is mostly driven by built-in criteria such as minimizing the number and priority of preempted tasks, picking machines that already have a copy of the task’s packages, spreading tasks across power and failure domains, and packing quality including putting a mix of high and low priority tasks onto a single machine to allow the high-priority ones to expand in a load spike.*

- Borglet: a local Borg agent that is present on every machine in a cell.It starts and stops tasks; restarts them if they fail; manages local resources by manipulating OS kernel settings; rolls over debug logs; and reports the state of the machine to the Borgmaster and other monitoring systems.

How Borgmaster work with Borglet?

The Borgmaster polls each Borglet every few seconds to retrieve the machine’s current state and send it any outstanding requests. The elected master is responsible for preparing messages to send to the Borglets and for updating the cell’s state with their responses. If a Borglet does not respond to several poll messages its machine is marked as down and any tasks it was running are rescheduled on other machines. If communication is restored the Borgmaster tells the Borglet to kill those tasks that have been rescheduled, to avoid duplicates. A Borglet continues normal operation even if it loses contact with the Borgmaster, so currently-running tasks and services stay up even if all Borgmaster replicas fail.

- Scalability:
    - **Score caching:** Evaluating feasibility and scoring a machine is expensive, so Borg caches the scores until the properties of the machine or task change.
    - **Equivalence classes:** Borg only does feasibility and scoring for one task per equivalence class – a group of tasks with identical requirements.
    - **Relaxed randomization:** To reduce wasteful calculation, the scheduler examines machines in a random order until it has found “enough” feasible machines to score, and then selects the best within that set.

## Availability

- automatically reschedules evicted tasks, on a new machine if necessary;
- reduces correlated failures by spreading tasks of a job across failure domains such as machines, racks, and power domains;
- limits the allowed rate of task disruptions and the number of tasks from a job that can be simultaneously down during maintenance activities such as OS or machine upgrades;
- uses declarative desired-state representations and idempotent mutating operations, so that a failed client can harmlessly resubmit any forgotten requests;
- rate-limits ﬁnding new places for tasks from machines that become unreachable, because it cannot distinguish between large-scale machine failure and a network partition;
- avoids repeating task::machine pairings that cause task or machine crashes; andrecovers critical intermediate data written to local disk by repeatedly re-running a logsaver task, even if the alloc it was attached to is terminated or moved to another machine. Users can set how long the system keeps trying; a few days is common.

A key design feature in Borg is that already-running tasks continue to run even if the Borgmaster or a task’s Borglet goes down.

## Lessons for Kubernetes

### Bad

- Jobs are restrictive as the only grouping mechanism for tasks.

    *To avoid such difﬁculties, Kubernetes rejects the job notion and instead organizes its scheduling units (pods) using labels – arbitrary key/value pairs that users can attach to any object in the system.*

- One IP address per machine complicates things.

    *In Kubernets, every pod and service gets its own IP address, allowing developers to choose ports rather than requiring their software to adapt to the ones chosen by the infrastructure, and removes the infrastructure complexity of managing ports.*

- Optimizing for power users at the expense of casual ones.

    *Build automation tools and services that run on top of Borg, and determine appropriate settings from experimentation.*

### Good

- Allocs are useful.

    The Kubernetes equivalent of an alloc is the pod, which is a resource envelope for one or more containers that are always scheduled onto the same machine and can share resources. Kubernetes uses helper containers in the same pod instead of tasks in an alloc, but the idea is the same.

- Cluster management is more than task management.

    Kubernetes supports naming and load balancing using the service abstraction: a service has a name and a dynamic set of pods deﬁned by a label selector. Any container in the cluster can connect to the service using the service name. Under the covers, Kubernetes automatically load-balances connections to the service among the pods that match the label selector, and keeps track of where the pods are running as they get rescheduled over time due to failures.

- Introspection is vital.

    Kubernetes ships with tools such as *cAdvisor* for resource monitoring, and log aggregation based on *Elasticsearch/Kibana* and *Fluentd*. The master can be queried for a snapshot of its objects’ state. Kubernetes has a uniﬁed mechanism that all components can use to record events (e.g., a pod being scheduled, a container failing) that are made available to clients.

- The master is the kernel of a distributed system.

    Kubernets has an API server at its core that is responsible only for processing requests and manipulating the underlying state objects. The cluster management logic is built as small, composable micro-services that are clients of this API server, such as the replication controller, which maintains the desired number of replicas of a pod in the face of failures, and the node controller, which manages the machine lifecycle.

### [S] - [HTTP/3 Replaces TCP with UDP to Boost Network Speed, Reliability](https://thenewstack.io/http-3-replaces-tcp-with-udp-to-boost-network-speed-reliability/)
---
When network works perfectly, HTTP/2 makes better use of network bandwidth by sending multiple HTTP requests over the same connection allowing applications to process requests concurrently.

With poor connection, HTTP/2 problem:
> TCP guarantees that the order in which packets are sent is the order in which received by the app — so if you miss one, everything has to stop until that particular packet gets retransmitted. If you multiplex multiple requests onto a single TCP connection, then all those requests have to stop and wait even though the lost packet might affect only one of them.
>
>This ‘head of line blocking problem is inherent to TCP and using UDP fixes it by allowing the application to control the retransmission of packets, Graham-Cumming explains. “It can say ‘that packet is missing but it only affects this one stream of data and the other streams of data can keep going’.”

HTTP/3 use UDP to solve HTTP/2 problem. and 

HTTP/3 also integrates TLS directly
