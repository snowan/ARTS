1. LC - Number of Connected Components in an Undirectly Graph (Java)

### Solution: [Union Find](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Disjoint-set_data_structure)
Steps:
* Union all nodes into components
* Find number of components
```java
/**
 * Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of nodes),
 * write a function to find the number of connected components in an undirected graph.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *      0          3
 *
 *      |          |
 *
 *      1 --- 2    4
 *
 * Given n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [3, 4]], return 2.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *      0           4
 *
 *      |           |
 *
 *      1 --- 2 --- 3
 *
 * Given n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]], return 1.
 *
 *  Note:
 *
 * You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges. Since all edges are undirected,
 * [0, 1] is the same as [1, 0] and thus will not appear together in edges.
