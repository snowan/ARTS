1. LC - Number of Connected Components in an Undirectly Graph (Java)
Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of nodes), write a function to find the number of connected components in an undirected graph.

Example 1:

Given n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [3, 4]], return 2.
Example
Given graph:

Return {A,B,D}, {C,E}. Since there are two connected component which is {A,B,D}, {C,E}
