/**
 * 200. Number of Islands
 * Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands.
 * An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically.
 * You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input:
 * 11110
 * 11010
 * 11000
 * 00000
 *
 * Output: 1
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input:
 * 11000
 * 11000
 * 00100
 * 00011
 *
 * Output: 3

### [R] - [IBM's old playbook](https://stratechery.com/2018/ibms-old-playbook/)
---
- Why IBM acquire Red Hat?
  - IBM ICloud business is not competite with AWS, GCP, Azure etc
  - IBM cannot attract talents
  - IBM is trying to use Red Hat tech and resources, and combine with Kubernetes on ICloud, and provide seemlyless config on ICloud

- Questions on IBM acquired Red Hat - not good rating on the acquire


### [T] - [CLI-Improved](https://remysharp.com/2018/08/23/cli-improved)

CLI command tools, thought `ctrl+r` is alreay cool, until see this post, `fzf` fuzz find. and more.

Try it out, and it will help you save your ass~~ :p

### [S] - [Log file](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Log_file)

>耗叔命题作业<关于日志的那些事儿>,目标是一篇“引经据典”的,“全面系统”的对日志的介绍!

We talk about logs, how important keep logging, etc every day during development. So what is log, why it is so important, and how to keep a good logs for your applications etc. Today, we will briefly talk about log file during development.

1. What is log file? (from [Wiki](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Log_file))
   >In computing, a log file is a file that records either events that occur in an operating system or other software runs,[1] or messages between different users of a communication software.[citation needed] Logging is the act of keeping a log. In the simplest case, messages are written to a single log file.
  
  Log file record **what happened** and **when happened**, **triggered by whom**.

2. Why log file (importance)? - locate problem, to find the root cause of issues, keep things under control~
   - For developers
      Developers write code and need to diagnose problems/issues during and after development, especially important when on prod or other environments which developers don't have access to or no debugging tools. Log files can help locate problems. Thus, developers can analyze logs and fix bugs.
    
  - For Sysadmins
      Operators, system administrators, when they things not working properly, like a overload of CPU, out of memory, spike QPS on MySQL, etc. They need to check logs and locate problems, and making things (applications) keep stable. Logs are extremely important for all kinds of issues they are daily dealing with.
  
  - For security team
      We know how important security is to our application, security teams check logs and analyze logs, to detect the attackers' information, in order to come up with proper ways to stop all kinds of attack, and keep application/system robust, protect our system safe.
  
  - For Data analitics
      We keep event logs - record events, like user all kinds of behaviour data, (how many times user logged in, how long user stay, which paper user stay longer, etc.) All these are super valuable data from user, so we can better market our apps, and target more potential users to help growth and marketing compagain...
  
  3. Log types:
    - [Server Log](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Server_log) (source from wiki)
        - >A server log is a log file (or several files) automatically created and maintained by a server consisting of a list of activities it performed.
        - Types: web server log, access log, error log, referrer log.
        - Server logs do not collect user-specific information
    - [Event log](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Log_file#/Event_logs)
        - >Event logs record events taking place in the execution of a system in order to provide an audit trail that can be used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. They are essential to understand the activities of complex systems, particularly in the case of applications with little user interaction (such as server applications).
        - Event logs can also be user behaviour data, developer can added event logs and help collect all kinds of user behaviours, thus aggregate logs can provide more insight of how user act on your application, and help growth and marketing purpose
    - [Message log](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Log_file#/Message_logs)
        - >Message logs are almost universally plain text files, but IM and VoIP clients (which supports textual chat, e.g. Skype) might save them in HTML files or in a custom format to ease reading and encryption.
    - [Syslog](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Syslog) - a standard for Message logging.
        - >It allows separation of the software that generates messages, the system that stores them, and the software that reports and analyzes them. Each message is labeled with a facility code, indicating the software type generating the message, and assigned a severity level.
        - Including **facility code** and the **severity level**

  4. Log formats - [Common log format](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Common_Log_Format)
   
    Example:

  ```
  127.0.0.1 user-identifier frank [10/Oct/2000:13:55:36 -0700] "GET /apache_pb.gif HTTP/1.0" 200 2326
  ```

  From the log, can identify below info: (source from [Wiki](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Common_Log_Format#/Example))
  - IP address (`127.0.0.1`) from requester either from client or remote server.
  - [HTTP status code](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/HTTP_status_code) (`200`)
  - log happened date, time and timezone, `10/Oct/2000:13:55:36 -0700`  
  - [HTTP Protocol](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) `GET /apache_pb.gif HTTP/1.0` 
  - Content size returned to client from server `2326` 
  - `frank` is the userid of the person requesting the document. 

  [Log4j](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Log4j)

  In Java development, we usually use Log4j, with Log4j2, we can define custom log levels, and also it support [yaml file](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/YAML), which making setting up configuration much easier than [XML](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/XML).
  
  Example log4j configuration: (from [Apache log configuration](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/configuration.html))

  ```yaml
  Configuration:
  status: warn
  name: YAMLConfigTest
  properties:
    property:
      name: filename
      value: target/test-yaml.log
  thresholdFilter:
    level: debug
  appenders:
    Console:
      name: STDOUT
      PatternLayout:
        Pattern: "%m%n"
    File:
      name: File
      fileName: ${filename}
      PatternLayout:
        Pattern: "%d %p %C{1.} [%t] %m%n"
      Filters:
        ThresholdFilter:
          level: error

  Loggers:
    logger:
      -
        name: org.apache.logging.log4j.test1
        level: info
        additivity: false
        ThreadContextMapFilter:
          KeyValuePair:
            key: test
            value: 123
        AppenderRef:
          ref: STDOUT
      -
        name: org.apache.logging.log4j.test2
        level: debug
        additivity: false
        AppenderRef:
          ref: File
    Root:
      level: error
      AppenderRef:
        ref: STDOUT

  ```
    
  Log4j log levels (below description source from [Wiki](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Log4j))

  The following table defines the built-in log levels and messages in Log4j, in decreasing order of severity. The left column lists the log level designation in Log4j and the right column provides a brief description of each log level.

  |**Level**  |	**Description**|
  |-----------:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
  |**OFF**	| The highest possible rank and is intended to turn off logging.|
  |**FATAL**	| Severe errors that cause premature termination. Expect these to be immediately visible on a status console.|
  |**ERROR**	| Other runtime errors or unexpected conditions. Expect these to be immediately visible on a status console.|
  |**WARN**	|Use of deprecated APIs, poor use of API, 'almost' errors, other runtime situations that are undesirable or unexpected, but not necessarily "wrong". Expect these to be immediately visible on a status console.|
  |**INFO**	|Interesting runtime events (startup/shutdown). Expect these to be immediately visible on a console, so be conservative and keep to a minimum.|
  |**DEBUG**	|Detailed information on the flow through the system. Expect these to be written to logs only. Generally speaking, most lines logged by your application should be written as DEBUG. |
  |**TRACE**	|Most detailed information. Expect these to be written to logs only. Since version 1.2.12.[11]|

  #### Custom log levels

  Log4j2 allows users to define their own log levels.[12] A source code generator tool is provided to create Loggers that support custom log levels identically to the built-in log levels. Custom log levels can either complement or replace the built-in log levels.
