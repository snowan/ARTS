### [A] - LC 22: Generate Parentheses

```java

import java.util.ArrayList;

/**
 * 22. Generate Parentheses
 *
 * Given n pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses.
 *
 * For example, given n = 3, a solution set is:
 *
 * [
 *   "((()))",
 *   "(()())",
 *   "(())()",
 *   "()(())",
 *   "()()()"
 * ]
 */

   * we keep track of left and right (open and close) brackets, 
   * comparing remaining open and close brackets, return when open > close. 
   * When count to open and close brackets = 0, add into res.
   * Keep tracking of left, left > 0, add "(" into current String,
   * Keep tracking right, right > 0, add ")" into current String

JVM vs JRE vs JDK

#### What is Java Virtual Machine(JVM)?
The Java virtual machine(JVM) is an abstract computer and provide a runtime environmenet to execute java 
bytecodes and load class files.

JVM main operations:
- Loading required `.class` files and jar files
- Assign references and verification code
- Execution the code
- Provide runtime environment for Java bytecodes

Overview Java Virtural Machine(JVM) architecture ([source from Wiki](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/**Java_virtual_machine)):

#### Java Class Loader
The Java Classloader is a part of the Java Runtime Environment that dynamically loads Java classes(`.class` files) and saving the bytecode in the JVM method area. the classloader subsystem handles the dynamic class loading functionality. Delegation is one main principles of Java Class Loader.

When the JVM is started, three class loaders are used:

1. Bootstrap class loader

    which loads the core Java libraries located in `<JAVA_HOME>/jre/lib` (i.e, `rt.jar`)
2. Extensions class loader

    Which loads the code in the extentions directories `<JAVA_HOME>/jre/lib/ext` or `java.ext.dirs`. Implemented by `sun.misc.Launcher$ExtClassLoader` class.

3. System class loader(Application class)

    Which loads code found on `java.class.path`, maps to the `CLASSPATH` environment variable. Implemented by `sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader` class.

Overview of the ClassLoader subsystem[1]:

How Java ClassLoader Hierarchy Delegation works[1]:
![alt text](./images/Java_classload_hierarchy.png)
Delegation: According to the Delegation Hierarchhy:
- JVM will check whether the specified `.class` file is loaded or not when JVM needs to load a class.
- If the `.class` file is already loaded in the method area, then JVM will consider that class. If not, JVM requests the classloader subsystem to load that specific class.
- The classloader system will use double parent delegation system to pass the request to the **Application classloader** then delegates to the **Extension classloader**. The Extension classloader will again delegate this request to the **Primordial(Bootstrap) classloader**
- The **Primordial(Bootstrap) classloader** will search this class in the bootstrap classpath (i.e. `jdk\jre\lib\rt.jar`).  Found, then load, if not, delegate back to **Extension classloader**, found then load, if not, then continue delegation back to **Application classloader**, found then load, if not, then throw `ClassNotFountException` at runtime.

[T] - [A Pinterest Engineering guid to technical interview](https://medium.com/@Pinterest_Engineering/a-pinterest-engineering-guide-to-technical-interviews-1c2471c2d139)

Recently I start preparing for interviews. Had phone screen with Uber, Netflix and SQuare recruiter,

My experience of phone screen with recruiters:
1. Know your resume well, will be better to prepare/write down a note(brief description of your main projects, try to highlight your responsibilities and contributions)
   
    For example, you worked on project A, then describe the main functions/features of project A, you can say I improved A's performance by 50% etc.
2. Some recruiters may ask why company X, try to read the position you are applying and knowing the company's culture. Try to give some details of the products (better try it out before the interivew)

Phone Screen is only considering your commmunication and passion of the company. 

Phone Technical Screen interview,
  
1. Be sure to prepare a short introduction of your experience.
2. Communication skills are important, don't straightly dive into solution, try to ask clarification questions. 
3. Make sure talk out load of your thoughts whild coding solutions. Always good to communicate with interviewer, ask them whether it is clear, good to start coding. 
4. Prepare some questions at last to ask interviewers, (show your interests and passion)
    
    Like: 
    - what is the team culture like? 
    - what is the tech stack like of the your team?
    - what makes you work and stay with the company? etc.
   
Luckily, you went to on site interview, then prepare for one day, most company will have 5-7 rounds interivews scheduled for you, including data structure, system design, problem solving, debugging, behaviour questions, etc.

1. Ask recruiters for interview details (what kind of interview will be on each round).
2. Data structure/algorithm round, again, ask clarification quesitons before start coding. 
3. Communication (talk out loud) is very important, and be nice (which most of candidate will be).
4. If you stuck, you can walk through your thoughts with interivewer, and they will try to help you (give your hints)

P.S. I like this article about [How to System Design](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-system-design-dda63ed27e26), now more and more training companies are helping students preparing interviews out there, and you can find one that will help you be outstanding during interviews, and from this article one opinion I appreciated the most is that you should show your own unique strengh during interviews, don't blur the most popular names, (e.g, you say dynamodb, google spanner etc, and you don't know how it works). 
  
Happy Interviewing (to myself :p)!

you can find many more information, actually reading this articles are more giving myslef some confidence.  

[S] - [Scheduling Notebooks at Netflix](https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/scheduling-notebooks-348e6c14cfd6)
---
1. Provide a better interfaces to connect developer, data science, data analyists. 
2. Notebook interfaces are very flexible, so they added some constrains to better server their internal use.
3. Use current infrastructure to connect Ad huck.
4. Implemented DAG hypothetical workflow for developers, breaking our work into logical units of work(collect data -> aggregate data -> report), multiple notebooks needed, and each for unit work scheduler.
5. Add debugging feature
6. Integrate with notebooks instead of adopting notebooks.
