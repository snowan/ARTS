/**
 * 915. Partition Array into Disjoint Intervals
 *
 * Given an array A, partition it into two (contiguous) subarrays left and right so that:
 *
 * Every element in left is less than or equal to every element in right.
 * left and right are non-empty.
 * left has the smallest possible size.
 * Return the length of left after such a partitioning.  It is guaranteed that such a
 * partitioning exists.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: [5,0,3,8,6]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: left = [5,0,3], right = [8,6]
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: [1,1,1,0,6,12]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: left = [1,1,1,0], right = [6,12]
 *
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * 2 <= A.length <= 30000
 * 0 <= A[i] <= 10^6
 * It is guaranteed there is at least one way to partition A as described.

/**
 * 919. Complete Binary Tree Inserter
 *
 * A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the
 * last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.
 *
 * Write a data structure CBTInserter that is initialized with a complete binary tree
 * and supports the following operations:
 *
 * CBTInserter(TreeNode root) initializes the data structure on a given tree with head
 * node root;
 * CBTInserter.insert(int v) will insert a TreeNode into the tree with value node.val =
 * v so that the tree remains complete, and returns the value of the parent of the
 * inserted TreeNode;
 * CBTInserter.get_root() will return the head node of the tree.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: inputs = ["CBTInserter","insert","get_root"], inputs = [[[1]],[2],[]]
 * Output: [null,1,[1,2]]
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: inputs = ["CBTInserter","insert","insert","get_root"], inputs = [[[1,2,3,4,5,
 * 6]],[7],[8],[]]
 * Output: [null,3,4,[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]]

 *
 * Note:
 *
 * The initial given tree is complete and contains between 1 and 1000 nodes.
 * CBTInserter.insert is called at most 10000 times per test case.
 * Every value of a given or inserted node is between 0 and 5000.

[R] - [Paxos Algorithm](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Paxos_(computer_science))
---
Paxos used to solve 2PC/3PC drawbacks, i.e. data inconsistency

Paxos purpose:
> Guranttee final chosen value, once value be chosen, processes will get final agreed value. 

>The Paxos family of protocols includes a spectrum of trade-offs between the number of processors, number of message delays before learning the agreed value, the activity level of individual participants, number of messages sent, and types of failures. Although no deterministic fault-tolerant consensus protocol can guarantee progress in an asynchronous network (a result proved in a paper by Fischer, Lynch and Paterson[6]), Paxos guarantees safety (consistency), and the conditions that could prevent it from making progress are difficult to provoke.

Roles: 
- **Proposer**
  > A Proposer advocates a client request, attempting to convince the Acceptors to agree on it, and acting as a coordinator to move the protocol forward when conflicts occur.
- **Acceptor** (Voter)
  >The Acceptors act as the fault-tolerant "memory" of the protocol. Acceptors are collected into groups called Quorums. Any message sent to an Acceptor must be sent to a Quorum of Acceptors. Any message received from an Acceptor is ignored unless a copy is received from each Acceptor in a Quorum.
- **Leaner**
  > Learners act as the replication factor for the protocol. Once a Client request has been agreed on by the Acceptors, the Learner may take action (i.e.: execute the request and send a response to the client). To improve availability of processing, additional Learners can be added.

Paxos make use that there is only one propose be accepted by the majority acceptors (more than half, so acceptors number must be odd number, i.e. 3, 5, etc)

In real world, one process can act multiple roles, e.g, one process can be proposer, and accecptor, and learner.

Another important concept is **Proposal**, the final agreed value is in Proposal.


Basic Paxos has two phases:
1. Phase I
    - Propose chose one proposal N(PN), and send PN **prepare request** to majorty acceptors (here majority means more than half). 
    - If one acceptor receive PN request, and N > all prepared requests sequence number accepted by this acceptor. Then this acceptor will send back N to proposer. And this acceptor will not longer receive sequence number < N proposal.

2. Phase II
    - Assume proposer receives majority Acceptors' response with N Prepared proposal. It will send **[N, V]** to majortiy Acceptor. 
    - Acceptor receive [N, V] proposal request, it will response back (meaning it will accpet [N, V] proposal) only when it didn't response any Sequence > N proposal already.

Notes: 
- N - Sequence number
- V - value within proposal with the max sequence number.

In this article, author states InnoDB's inefficiencies. and how they use [RocksDB]((https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki)) as InnoDB -> MyRocks.
>there are also some inefficiencies with InnoDB. For example, although flash storage devices are widely used for OLTP workloads, we are limited to less storage. While our database engineering team worked to make compressed InnoDB performant for read-write workloads, which reduced the size of our UDB tier by approximately 40 percent, we wanted to make further improvements beyond what was possible with InnoDB.

RocksDB, persistent key-value store based on  log-structured merge-trees (LSM), which requires less storage I/O per updates, other than InnoDB, (B+ trees structure) which needs to do a large number of random reads and writes.
